# Currency Converter in Kotlin

## Description

Welcome to my Currency Converter App project! This is an Android application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio, with an emphasis on crafting a refined user experience with a modern and intuitive GUI. 

This project is a substantial revamp of my initial attempt at creating a currency converter app in Java. However, this time, I have leveraged a new currency converter API and the power of Kotlin, all the while honing my Android Studio skills.

A unique feature that I've incorporated into this app is a Morse Code converter. This might seem like an unusual addition to a currency converter app, but I believe it adds an element of fun and intrigue to the user experience.

## Highlights 

- **Currency Conversion**: Seamlessly convert between various world currencies in real-time using a powerful currency converter API. 
- **Morse Code Conversion**: Add a touch of historical cryptography to your daily routine. Convert your text to Morse Code and vice versa.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Experience a smooth and intuitive user interface that ensures ease of use.
- **Built with Kotlin**: The app is written in Kotlin, demonstrating its efficiency over the Java version.

## Technical Features

- **Retrofit API**: The backbone of the network handling in this app is provided by the Retrofit library, enabling effective communication with the currency converter API.
- **Android Studio**: This project serves as a practical application of Android Studio skills, emphasizing both coding in Kotlin and GUI development.

## Future Enhancements

As this project is ongoing, I intend to continue refining and expanding the app's functionality. Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome and would be immensely helpful in directing future development.
